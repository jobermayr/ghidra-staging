Subject: [PATCH] 0801: Fix x86-16 Windows cspec for stdcall ambiguity

x86-64-win.cspec deals with __fastcall and __thiscall by simply (somewhat misleadingly) specifying extrapop="8" and letting the resolution occur in the decompiler.  Really it should be "8 + args"

x86win.cspec deals with __stdcall, __thiscall and __fastcall by specifying extrapop="unknown" which although true fails to make an expectation that "unknown" means "4 + args" and it would be a stretch to say it could be inferred from pentry stack addresses.  It deals with this using a resolveprototype construct and an eval_current_prototype to allow selection instead of the default.

I propose either we do the same for x86-16.cspec or change "unknown" to "4" and use the 64-bit strategy.

This is likely a key part of the source of 4 reported issues although the decompiler should really handle prototype identification better and this is hardly the end of the story.  Problem a new XML attribute is needed - something like the now obsolete "stackshift" which would be an excellent hint!

Currently even with the selector - which all x86-16 bit files generally require - most use a mixture of far and near calling almost never one or the other exclusive.

But this change is a correct start towards fixing this entire area.

Update x86-16.cspec

Add first fixup for x86-16-win code which comes from C compiler library to check the stack - but not only that more importantly it is adjusting the stack.

Update x86-16.cspec

Found a mistake per the alloca_probe/__chkstk in x86win - the popping of the return address needs to be added back to the stack.

Update x86-16.cspec

Made consistent with x86win.cspec - alloca_probe is a better name for this.
